Software Systems Check

/*
Initial State:
*/
	Gear Pickup: Stowed and off
	Traction Feet: Retracted
	Intake Ramp: Stowed
	Shooter/Belt/Spinner: All off
	Wheels: Stopped
	Climber: Rachet Unlatched

/*
Action Tests:
*/
Wheels:
	Driver Joysticks drive test
	Check traction pads (all four corners)
	
	Driver DPad Down: Robot Centric (default)
	Driver DPad Up: Field Centric
	Driver DPad Left: Precision Mode (Robot centric @ 25% of normal)
	Driver DPad Right: Arcade Mode (no center wheel)
	
	Encoder Checks:
		While driving forward: Left side increases, Right side decreases
		While strafing: Going Left decreases count, going Right increases

Gear Pickup:
	Toggle Up/Down with Driver Right Trigger
	Intake / Release while Operator Left/Right Bumper Held
	Auto Pickup with Driver Left Bumper (same on Operator)
	Auto Deliver with Driver Right Bumper (same on Operator)
	
Traction Feet: 
	Deploy with Operator DPad Down;
	Retract with Operator DPad Up;
	Any joystick movement (X, Y, or Z) should cause retraction

Intake Ramp:
	Release using Operator DPad Right
	
Shooter / Belt / Spinner:
	Start Shooter & Belt using Driver Left Trigger
		- Left Trigger controls Spinner
		-Timeout after 10 seconds
		-Halt using Operator DPad Left
		- Operator X & B run Spinner FWD & BACK (Shooter keeps running)
		- Operator A & B run Belt UP & DOWN ( Shooter stops)
		- Smartdash buttons also control all three and shows tuning and speed data

Climber:
	Toggle Rachet using Driver Y button
