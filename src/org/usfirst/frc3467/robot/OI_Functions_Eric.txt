***** Operator Interface Functions ******

Triggers:
	(whenActive) - action is performed as soon as the control becomes active (i.e. button is pressed, stick is moved, etc.)
	(whileActive) - action is repeated continuously as long as control is active, and stops when control becomes inactive

Traction plates:
	- Go Down after Auto-Aiming or when Shooting
	- Traction plates should not go down until drivebase encoders show no (or minimal) velocity
	- On any drive joystick move -> traction plates come Up

Joysticks (Left and Right):
	Drive in various modes as determined by the DPad buttons:
		DPad Up = Field Centric Mode (default)	(whenActive)
		DPad Down = Robot Centric Mode		(whenActive)
		DPad Left = Precision Mode			(whenActive)
		DPad Right = Robot Centric (No CW)	(whenActive)

A Button - Auto-Aim & Shooter Power Up	(whileActive)
LT(Left Trigger) Power Up & Shoot ASAP	(whileActive)
		Auto-Aim:
			- Start Pixy camera high boiler goal tracking
			- Turn drivebase to aim at high boiler goal (any stick movement following this will cancel tracking; tracking may be resumed by entering Precision Drive mode (Y-button))
			- When on target, start spinner (slow) & drop traction plates
		Powering up the Shooter:
			-xxx Actuate Lower intake in
			-xxx Actuate High intake out
			- xxxRun Lower intake in
			- xxxRun High intake in
			- Run conveyor under Velocity control 
			- Run shooter wheels under Velocity Control (speed dependent on image in Pixy camers)
		Activating the Left Trigger does the following:
			- Run spinner at speed determined by Left Trigger movement (0.0 -> 1.0)
			- This permits Driver to control the flow of fuel out of the shooter, to allow for test shots, realignment, etc. without wasting a lot of fuel before proper alignment is achieved.
			
Y & B Buttons - Climb
	- Automated climber routine
	- Latch climber axle rachet; drive center wheel
	- Stop when center wheel current (read from PDB) reaches predetermined maximum value
	
X Button - "Zero" the Gyro
	- Save current setting as offset, and subtract from all subsequent readings.
			
LB(Left Bumper) GearIntake Down 		(whenActive)
		Gear intake down; roller running in
		When beam break indicates gear in, pause momentarily and then lift gear and stop roller at time TBD
	
RB(Right Bumper) GearIntake Up			(whenActive)
		Gear intake up; roller not running
	
RT(Right Trigger) Gear Hang 		(whenActive)
		Gear intake - down slow and run out (timing TBD)

Start Button - Switch between Speed and Voltage drive mode

X Button = RunSpinner Left		(whileActive)
B Button = RunSpinner Right		(whileActive)
Y Button = RunTower Up			(whileActive)
A Button = RunTower Down		(whileActive)

DPad (Directional Pad):
	DPad Up - Lift Traction Plates		(whenActive)
	DPad Down - Drop Traction Plates	(whenActive)
	xxxxxxDPad Left - Toggle Upper Intake position	(whenActive)
	xxxxxxDPad Right - Run Upper intake inward	(whileActive)


?Control? Climb Mode (whileActive)
	While in Climbing Mode:
		- Right (or Left?) Stick Y-axis controls climbing motor (whileActive)
		- Right Trigger locks climber rachet (whenActive)
