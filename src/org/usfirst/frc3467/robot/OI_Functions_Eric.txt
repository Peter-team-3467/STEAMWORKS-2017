***** Operator Interface Functions ******

Triggers:
	(whenActive) - action is performed as soon as the control becomes active (i.e. button is pressed, stick is moved, etc.)
	(whileActive) - action is repeated continuously as long as control is active, and stops when control becomes inactive

Traction plates:
	- Go Down after Auto-Aiming or when Shooting
	- Traction plates should not go down until drivebase encoders show no (or minimal) velocity
	- On any drive joystick move -> traction plates come Up

Joysticks (Left and Right):
	Drive in various modes as determined by the DPad buttons:
		DPad Up = Field Centric Mode (default)	(whenActive)
		DPad Down = Robot Centric Mode		(whenActive)
		DPad Left = Precision Mode			(whenActive)
		DPad Right = Robot Centric (No CW)	(whenActive)

A Button - Auto-Aim & Shooter Power Up	(whileActive)
LT(Left Trigger) Power Up & Shoot ASAP	(whileActive)
		Auto-Aim:
			- Start Pixy camera high boiler goal tracking
			- Turn drivebase to aim at high boiler goal (any stick movement following this will cancel tracking; tracking may be resumed by entering Precision Drive mode (Y-button))
			- When on target, start spinner (slow) & drop traction plates
		Powering up the Shooter:
			- Actuate Lower intake in
			- Actuate High intake out
			- Run Lower intake in
			- Run High intake in
			- Run shooter wheels under Velocity Control (speed dependent on image in Pixy camers)
		Activating the Left Trigger does the following:
			- Run conveyor and spinner at speed determined by Left Trigger movement (0.0 -> 1.0)
			- This permits Driver to control the flow of fuel out of the shooter, to allow for test shots, realignment, etc. without wasting a lot of fuel before proper alignment is achieved.
			
Y & B Buttons - Climb
	- Automated climber routine
	- Latch climber axle rachet; drive center wheel
	- Stop when center wheel current (read from PDB) reaches predetermined maximum value
	
X Button - "Zero" the Gyro
	- Save current setting as offset, and subtract from all subsequent readings.
			
LB(Left Bumper) LowerIntake  		(whenActive)
	Toggle:
		Lower intake out; running in
		Lower intake in; not running
	
RT(Right Trigger) Gear Catcher 		(whenActive)
	Toggle gear catcher angle

RB(Right Bumper) Gearclaw 			(whenActive)
	Toggle gearclaw hold/release

//  Operator GamePad

LT (Left Trigger) Hopper 		(whenActive)
	Toggle hopper contract/expand
	
RT (Right Trigger)  Run intakes	(whileActive)
	Run Upper and Lower intakes inward
	
LB (Left Bumper) Empty Hopper (whileActive)
	Run Lower intake outward
	
RB (Right Bumper) Toggle Lower Intake	(whenActive)
	Toggle Lower intake in/out
	
// Manual shooter feed controls (for freeing jams)
X Button = RunSpinner Left		(whileActive)
B Button = RunSpinner Right		(whileActive)
Y Button = RunTower Up			(whileActive)
A Button = RunTower Down		(whileActive)

DPad (Directional Pad):
	DPad Up - Lift Traction Plates		(whenActive)
	DPad Down - Drop Traction Plates	(whenActive)
	DPad Left - Toggle Upper Intake position	(whenActive)
	DPad Right - Run Upper intake inward	(whileActive)


?Control? Climb Mode (whileActive)
	While in Climbing Mode:
		- Right (or Left?) Stick Y-axis controls climbing motor (whileActive)
		- Right Trigger locks climber rachet (whenActive)
