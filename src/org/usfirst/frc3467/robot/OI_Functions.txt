***** Operator Interface Functions ******

Triggers:
	(whenActive) - action is performed as soon as the control becomes active (i.e. button is pressed, stick is moved, etc.)
	(whileActive) - action is repeated continuously as long as control is active, and stops when control becomes inactive

Joysticks (Left and Right)
	Drive in various modes as determined by the XYAB buttons:
		X Button = Field Centric Mode (default)	(whenActive)
		B Button = Robot Centric Mode		(whenActive)
		Y Button = Precision Mode			(whenActive)
		A Button = Robot Centric (No CW)	(whenActive)

DPad(Directional Pad) buttons:(whenActive)
	DPad Up - Lift Traction Plates
	DPad Down - Drop Traction Plates
		Traction plates:
			- Controlled by DPad Up/Down (see below)
			- Traction plates should not go down until drivebase encoders show no (or minimal) velocity
			- On any drive joystick move -> traction plates come up

	DPad Left - Shooter to Idle state (all off)
	DPad Right - Shooter to Powered Up state
	LT(Left Trigger) Shoot	(whileActive)
		Powering up the Shooter using DPad Right does the following:
			- Actuate Lower intake in
			- Actuate High intake out
			- Run Lower intake in
			- Run High intake in
			- Run shooter wheels under Velocity Control (speed dependent on image in Pixy camers)
			** Drop traction plates? (Do we really want to do this automatically when shooting?)
		Activating the Left Trigger does the following:
			- Run conveyor and spinner at speed determined by Left Trigger movement (0.0 -> 1.0)
			- This permits Driver to control the flow of fuel out of the shooter, to allow for test shots, realignment, etc. without wasting a lot of fuel before proper alignment is achieved.
